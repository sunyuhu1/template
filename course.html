			<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
			<p>WRA 110 is First-Year Writing contributes to the Michigan State University which is focusing on science and technology. Our section is focus on the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that successfully enhance writing, reading, and researching in the digital age. We did four major course assignments in this class, and they are: lived experiences project, cultural analysis proposal, formal research project, and remix project. At the end of the semester, we are going to put these four major assignments together and create a web version. This class is a bit different from other writing class. We only have one lecture each week that is because this class is a hybrid online class, so we just need to spend half time in class room, but learn rest of staffs online at anywhere, any time. This class is really covered lots of information about how to create personal web page, and how to write HTML, which is very useful for our future career.</p> 
<p>The first project is lived experience. This project lets students writing a narrative detailing how a specific technology helped them choosing their majors.  In my paper, I wrote about how computer science programming impacted my choice of major in business and focus on information system.  In this paper, I did lots of researches about how business information system contributes to our life. This specific path allows me to combine my two passions, business and computer together. Business information and technology can support our business processes and operations, decision making, and improve competitive advantage. In the modern world, it can save numerous relevant information, and transfer to useful data when we need to use them. The business information can help us response to business case as soon as possible, and avoid mistakes as much as we can. It provides relevant and accurate information to all organization, firms, and individuals. It makes our business and life easier and simpler. I believe this is a perfect major for me. Also, this is a great start about deep thinking our future career path. </p>
<p>The second assignment is cultural analysis proposal. This project lets us analysis a specific cultural artifact, and how this artifact related with social issues. Also, we need give some suggestion about how to solve those social issues. In this paper, I introduced how the moon-cakes are an important artifact in Chinese cultural, and how moon-cakes caused some social issues in our culture. Lots of Chinese people now spend lots of money on over packaged and high priced moon cakes as gifts to send to their friends, colleagues, supervisors, and bosses. My culture artifact, these more expensive moon cakes, increases environmental pollution and creates bribery. The general moon cake boxes materials include wrapping papers, plastics, metals, which may cause environmental pollution. High priced moon cakes being given as gifts will be used as bribery. Finally, I think no matter you get the cheap or expensive moon cakes to other people; they both can express your best wishes. We should focus more on the meaning of Mid-autumn Festival which is celebrating and gathering with your friends and family members, not send the expensive gifts to other people. This paper can helps us think more about our own culture and find out some social issues. In this paper, our instructor required all of us to provide the references we used in this paper. This is a start of how to do academic research in university level.</p> 
<p>The third assignment we did is formal research proposal. This is the most complicated project we did in this semester. This project helped us deeply thought more about the major we chose, and detailed introduce that discipline we are interested in. This project helped us begin to know how to use MSU library research tools. We also need to complete an interview with one of the academic professor who is familiar with the discipline which we chose.  This lets us getting close to our academic professor and gets more information in that academic area. In my project, I chose Finance major as my academic discipline. From my researches and interviews, financial investment is emphasis on stock investment and bond investment. That means both stock investment and bond investment are business methods that can help investors gain benefits, but both of them may have invested risks. Basically, the stock investments have higher risk than bond investments. The majority of finance majors who are interested in financial investment field will choose stock analyst or bond analyst to be their future career. (But if you want to be a personal investment advisor, then you will be stock analyst and bond analyst at the same time, as I said before.) Through collecting and evaluating business data and information, we can predict the specific stock or bond's future financial trend, and help individuals or corporations gain maximum investment profits is the primary job for both stock analyst and bond analyst. The highly improved technology can make finance process and finance analysts' job easier and more efficient than before. Also, if you want to be a successful finance analyst, you should be a life-long learner and keep the most advanced business information, and you should control good communication skills to communicate with your client or corporation managers effectively. Hope this information can help incoming students who is interested in Finance major.</p> 
<p>The last assignment we did is the remix project, and this project is a group work. The first part of this project is we need to create a video which should be 7-9 minutes long. The second part of this project is writing a memo for the video which we created, and that is for individual work.  We can revise one of our earlier projects through this remix project, then, transforming it into an alternative form of a short documentary. Finally, we need create a video with our teammates. I think that is the most important assignment for this course. Firstly, we need to know how to work with other people in our group, like how to assign different work to each person, and how to pick up the meeting time. Working in a group means you always need to consider other people¡¯s feeling, you cannot always put yourself in the center of everything. Secondly, we need to learn some technical strategy by ourselves, like how to create a short video on YouTube. I was in a fantastic group this semester. I learned lots of important things from them, and I really enjoy stay with them. The hardest part for this project is how to make the video, because almost all of us in this group never did this before. We spend lots of time find resources online, and ask our friends who is major in computer science for help. This part is much more complicated than what I expected, but finally we figured it out. Look about our remix video that is amazing. This project helped me learned a lot about how to be a successful student in university. Sometimes, we will meet some trouble in our life, like the remix project. This assignment is heavily weighted on this class, but none of us in our group know how to get started. We can choose either give up or keep going but neither of us gave up, we did it finally.  That means, in our real life, when we have some difficulties, we should try our best to solve them, and not just simply skip them. Learn how to solve problem is a very important personality in the world. People who can get success in their future career path always are a great learner, and know how to reduce the pressure.</p>    
After I took this class, I felt much better when I need to write a long project. This class is really different than the previous writing class I take before. It is combined writing and fundamental technology together. Through this class, I not only improved my writing skills, but also learned how to write basic HTML and how to make personal web page. Even we only need go to class one time each week, we still need work very hard on this course. The HTML is very useful, but it is also very challenge. At the beginning of the semester, I was totally lost, and I just have no idea how to get start. But I meet a perfect classmate, he helped me a lot. Everyone in this class are very friendly and helpful, they always teaches me how to write some advanced HTML code. After the class, we spend lots of time stick together, we discuss about how to improve our skills in this class, how to choose our future career path, and some interesting life stories. This class is really interesting for me, through this class; I learned lots of useful information which are beyond textbook. I will recommend this class to my friend, and I think all of the incoming students will like it.
