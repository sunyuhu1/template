			<p>In class activity1:   in class discussion about understanding homosexuality 
	<p>The purpose of this video is try to let people understand and accept homosexuality. As the same as other people, they love their life, friends, and families. The only difference is they have different sexual orientation than other people. </p>
	<p>The man who is a guy use his own store to explain his life experiences about homosexuality and this can help people understand well about this specific group.</p>
        <p>the structure of the message is first come with some letters and pictures that include all the main points the author want to explain, then the author is come up and make a bravely explanation about his own store.</p> 
        <p>This video's structure help me found that when I write my lived experience project I should first come with an outline, like how my major is. Then, use my own store explain why I interested in this major and how my store related with that major which I chose.</p> 
<p>In class activity 2:   Today's class, we watched the video about Mark Zuckerberg.  He creates the face book which is the top one social network. Face book is very popular in the modern world, almost all of college students use face book. Everyone try to find an easy way to talk and get in touch with their friends and families. Face book did it, because it is very convenience and totally free. We can say mark changed our world, and face book is really amazing in our generation.</p> 

<p>In class activity 3:    Today's class, we watched some videos about advertisements. Great advertisement can help customers understand the key point much better.  Usually, the good strategy to make a video is use appropriate color and background information. The most famous company in Detroit is ford. Ford made lots of popular cars. So the author used Eminem's song to be the background music. Top singer plus famous car company, then, we can see a great advertisement.
