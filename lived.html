		<p> At the age of ten, I learned how to develop websites with HTML, and some simple programming. I still clearly remembered on one day class my teacher written some codes to the computer, then there is a tortoise came out and drawn a circle on the screen. That surprised me, Technology and computers therefore naturally interested me. On the other hand, I am very interested in business area, so I know I need to select a major which can combine computer and business together. For undergraduate student, I cannot narrow down my major in a specific area. So I decided major in finance, and Specialized in Information Technology. But I am sure; I will choose business information system and technology as my graduate school major and as my future career. </p>
                <p> Business information system and technology is a specific area of information system aims to support operations, management, and decision making for business process. Most companies today heavily rely on the use of business information system to run their business. Business information systems are often the underlying infrastructure performing for most companies' activities. Like order and ship goods, interact with customers, or conduct other business functions. Business information systems allow companies to remain competitive in today's fast-paced world and especially when conducting business on the internet. Organizations must adapt to technological advances and innovations to keep pace with today¡¯s rapidly changing environment. (ITM 309 lectures) Due to the information revolution, the computer has become helpful in managing knowledge at a time when the amount of information is expanding exponentially. That means the business information system can make our business process easier compared with use index cards or in an inventory book ¡ª or even in a Microsoft Office Word document. Business information system can store numerous relevant business information, and release or response for you when you need to use them. We move quickly in business, and we make decisions with breakneck speed. So we need to get appropriate information as soon as possible when we doing real business.  That why we need learning and using- business information system and technology. </p>
                <p> Careers in business information system and technology area include network administration, software engineering, systems analysis, and project management. The career paths I would like to work is systems analysis. A systems analyst designs new IT solutions to improve business efficiency and productivity. Like a bridge between two worlds, a business systems analyst works with both the business and technology teams to handle day-to-day business applications. As companies strive to keep up with major advances in technology or less significant software upgrades, you're the go-between when it comes to communicating those changes between departments. (money.cnn.com) In larger organizations, System Analysts make the communication between IT and Business departments possible, and study an organization's current computer systems and procedures and make recommendations to management to help the organization operate more effectively.</p>
                <p> During the summer of my freshman year, I opened an online store with my older sister. Operating this online shoes store helps me understand more about business information system and get lots of real work experiences on this area. When doing a real business, I must find out proper strategies to operate and manage this business. Such as record orders, ship goods, interact with customers, and store inventories.</p> 
            	<p> The first thing I want to talk about is record orders. Since there are large volumes of customers and suppliers, it's impossible to hand write all information. Now we can ask computer system for help. The Customer Order Entry database template makes it easy to add, change, or delete the following business data: 
?	Company information such as contact name; phone and fax number; and street, shipping, and Web addresses.
?	Customer order information such as the order and ship date, employee who took the order, and payment method.
?	Details of each order such as the product purchased, quantity sold, discount percentage (if any), and total price.
?	Information specific to your company such as the employees' names and your company's address.
?	Shipping and payment methods such as shipping company name (like UPS) and credit card information. (Access 2003, Microsoft) 
With Customer Order Entry database template¡¯s help, it¡¯s easy to collecting related data, and organizes information as a series of entries. That¡¯s really helpful for my business to save time, reduce cost, and to be more effective.</p> 
                 <p> Now, let¡¯s move on to the shipping part. Studies have shown that shipping fees are the number one factor driving shopping cart abandonment, and shipping date is another factor which affects transaction. So most on line stores are now offering free shipping, and that is a big part transaction cost for us. The real challenge when figuring out shipping strategy is determining a solution that can reduce traffic cost as much as possible, but still remain product¡¯s quality. What I can do is record all the orders on excel, and sorted by location, then by time. Try to find cheapest shipping company in different area, and make sure all the orders follows up first come first serve.</p>
                 <p> For the inventory, we can use quick books point to manage the inventory. This software can update inventory automatically as you ring up sales, returns, exchanges, and receive items so you instantly know what¡¯s in stock. Even better, built-in reorder points notify you when inventory is low, so you never run out of top sellers and lose a sale. (Quick books point 2013) That¡¯s helps you store appropriate volume products in your stock, and avoid high inventory cost.</p>  
                 <p> With the help of information technology, communication has also become cheaper, quicker, and more efficient. We can now communicate with anyone around the world by simply text messaging them or sending them an email. The internet has also opened up face to face direct communication from different parts of the world. That¡¯s makes me easy interact with customers, and get their feedback immediately after the transaction. </p>
                 <p> During that summer, I earned almost 3200 dollars for operating my on line shoes store. The business information system and technology¡¯s helps beside me all the time. It makes me fully understand his charm. After that summer, I fall in love with this major, and I know I made a right choice for myself.</p> 
                 <p> The business information technology allows me to combine my two passions, business and computer. With the nature love and lots of real experiences in these two areas, I believe I am on the right to choose my future career path. In conclusion, business information and technology can support of business processes and operations, support of decision making by employees and managers, and support of strategies for competitive advantage. In the modern world, it can save numerous relevant information, and transfer to useful data when we need to use them. The business information can help us response to business case as soon as possible, and avoid mistakes as much as we can. It provides relevant and accurate information to all organization, firms, and individuals. It makes our business and life easier and simpler.
