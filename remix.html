			<h1>Multimedia Remix Project Memo </h1>
			<p>The new technologies really improved our life a lot in now days, so our issue discussed in this project is the revolution of business information system. All group members in our group are major in business and computer science. That is why we chose business information system as our topic. When we compose it, we will introduce the revolution process from oldest to newest. This composition can help us better understanding how the new improved business information system convenient our daily life and business operation. When we try to compose our project, we found that there are some negative effects come from new business information systems, like information theft. That is very conflict with our topic which is introducing the positive aspects of new business information systems. The most challenging part in this project for us is how to add sounds to the video, because we do not have enough previous experiences about how to do this. We took systematic approach for this project, we have looked at least four newest business information systems in the world. These systems are very popular and high technology proved. We did lots of researches for these systems, like interview person directly and find some articles and papers. From those research experiences, I think the academic articles are most useful and relevant, because the information will be very comprehensive. On the other hand, I think interview with other people is least beneficial, because it takes long time to schedule the appointment and most of people we contact do not have direct research experiences with those business information systems which we are going to introduce. For our group, even there is a small accident, but I still really enjoy working and studying with them. They are amazing classmates, very nice and helpful. We have great interaction with each others. Everyone positively make contribution to our team project. I think we will continuous our friendship after this class ended. Working in groups is very helpful for us, because that helps us learning how to cooperate with other people, which is a very important characteristic for our future career life. I think we have a great plan on this project; we separate different tasks to each individual student and then bring the results together to create the final output. When we make the design decision, everyone in our group is free to give opinion and suggestion, and then we make a vote for how to make the final design. That is very effectiveness, and it saves lots of time and energy. The audiences for this project will be our classmates and incoming students. Our classmates can bring us some suggestion, and the incoming students can find out what WRA110 class focuses on. Finally, I will say this is a fantastic project for me, and I really enjoy it.</p>
