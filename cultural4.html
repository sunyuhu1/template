			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>With the rapidly economic development, and given the difficulty of making them, most people prefer to purchase their moon cakes instead of making them. You'll find them at Asian bakeries beginning around mid-August, which may range from general supermarkets to high-end restaurants. The price of moon cakes usually ranges from US$5 to US$30 for a box of four. This price range lasted for at least 20 years. But in 2007, the moon price of moon cakes increased to $100-$600. </p> 
<p> One of the reasons for the moon cake prices increased a lot is packaging cost. Typically, a Chinese family buys moon cakes in a simple box, usually one box include 4 pieces of moon cakes. Since about 2007, most moon cakes in Chinese markets are over packaged. But, like most packages, no matter how delicate and beautiful these moon cake boxes are, they are discarded after the cake is consumed. Because China is a large population country, even if each family just discards one box for that year, those discarded boxes are translated into big environmental pollution.</p>
<p>The luxurious moon cake boxes materials are generally include wrapping papers, plastics, and metals. To produce 1 ton of paper requires at least 17 trees and 1,750 liters of oil. Packaging paper is not a necessity (Green power. 2013). Excessive use of trees and oil will accelerate the Forest degradation, increase the shortage of petroleum resources, and damage the earth's ecosystems.</p>  
<p> Plastics take hundreds of years to decompose, so they will be in landfills for a long time. Production of every 100kg plastic releases 4.2kg carbon dioxide, which is a major greenhouse gas, aggravating global warming. Results in air pollution, forms acid rain and affects ecological balance. Many plastic products contain carcinogens. At high temperatures, these are released more quickly. Some of the chemical constituents may affect our reproductive ability and children's development. (Green power. 2013)</p>
<p> Moon cake boxes materials are also include iron. These, like aluminum cans, can be recycled to recover and reuse the metals. Simply throwing away these boxes and cans wastes metals. Producing one aluminum can, from raw materials to end product, releases 2g carbon dioxide. (Green power. 2013).These negative effects for over packaged moon cake boxes make lots of people begin to think that we need reduce use of moon cake boxes and protect our environment.</p>  
	<p>It is important to protect the environment because the natural environment is the most important resource for life. We get water, air, and energy from the environment. If we get too many resources from the nature and that is lead to run out of many resources and huge pollution to the nature. If we cannot reduce or stop over use resources from nature and reduce the environmental pollution, we will lose our natural environment for survival. That is why we need to reduce the quantities of moon cake boxes use.</p>  
	<p>Furthermore, some public companies and public departments buy high priced moon cakes as gifts for some commercial or promotional purpose. In this case, the high priced moon cakes used as bribery.</p>  
	<p>Luxurious boxes of moon cakes can contain far more than the traditional moon cakes filling. Gift within that luxurious boxes can even include items such as gold coins, top-notch wines, expensive teas, or 4G mobile phones. Some companies even use real gold to make gold moon cakes, Such as following news published in Beijing.</p>
<p>BEIJING, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Gold moon cakes made their debut in the gift sector ahead of China's back-to-back autumn holiday but suspicions of corruption have been raised. Made of pure gold, the moon cake-shaped artifact witnessed good sales on the eve of China's traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon cake Festival. "Most of the buyers are groups of clients of companies and enterprises who have bought gold moon cakes as a gift," said a shop assistant in a department store in Xuan wu men in downtown Beijing on Friday. One of the most favored gift boxes consists of two pieces, which weigh 50 grams each. The price is 42,900 yuan (6,821 U.S. dollars), equaling to 429 yuan per gram. The price of standard metal bars is around 360 yuan. (English.news.cn. 2013)</p>
<p> Can we really eat the gold moon cakes? The answer is absolutely not. It means the sale of gold moon cakes is high priced gifts, which is bribery. It also creates lots of public concerns.</p> 
<p> As the moon cakes are filled with more commercial purposes, sending moon cakes to friends, colleges, teachers, supervisors, and bosses bring a lot of pressure to multi families. Cause in China, The average family income is around just $800-$900 in most cities. The high priced moon cakes will cost them lots of money, and disturbed their normal life. In Chinese culture, Relationships in China are very formal and important. One thing can remain and improve relationships between people is gift giving. Now days more and more people use high priced moon cakes as Mid-Autumn festival gifts to other people. If you do not send expensive moon cakes to your colleagues, supervisors, friends, professors for your kids, that means these people are not valuable in your mind, you will displease them. On the other hand, if you send expensive moon cakes to one of those important people, you need send the same value expensive moon cakes to the rest of them on your list, otherwise you still will displease some of them. That is why most people do not want buy high priced moon cakes to other people, and neither receives these expensive moon cakes. Most reasons people chose these high priced moon cakes as gifts are: need supervisor give them a promotion in next year, try to help their kids get into a good college, want the permission from government official departments to get into some high barrier business(like energy, oil, banking area business).</p>
<p> People who received the expensive moon cake can also feel uncomfortable.  Because we need figure out how to return or pay them back. For example, my family can receive some high priced moon cakes in Mid-Autumn festival every year, but when I am back to China, I need buy some equal valued gifts to those people who sent gifts to our family during that holiday. It cost me lots of time to help my parents finding proper gifts to their friends and colleges. Actually, that waste us lots of money, because we do not need that many moon cakes, but it cost my family lots of money send gifts back to those people who give moon cakes as gift to our family.</p> 
<p> Those people who bribed teachers, supervisors, government official departments and who achieved their goal is unfair to the rest of other people and society. They did not spending enough efforts to achieve their goal, but bribery help them get what they want. If things continue this way, most people will stop use the right way to working hard to get what they want. Then, this undesired phenomenon will bring lots of negative effects to our society and cannot be reversed. </p>
