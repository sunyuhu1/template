			<h1>Finance major </h1>
			<p>Do you know what finance major is? Do you know how many branches of finance there are? Finance is a major that includes a wide range of branches, such as business financial administration, management of financial institutions, investments, financial markets, and the management of risk. (Register of office in Michigan State University. 2012). As many students chose their major very careful, I also did research before I enrolled into the finance major. I am finance major student at Michigan State University, and I want to work in a financial investment area after I graduate. The field of investments involves the analysis and selection of securities with special emphasis on stocks and bonds. (Register of office in Michigan State University. 2012). In this essay, I will focus on giving some relevant information to students who are interested in majoring in finance, such as typical jobs in finance major, technologies used in finance area, and how communication skills supported in finance major. In order to deliver this information, I will, through five aspects, introduce and explain it. Firstly, where is the career field for finance majors who are interested in the financial investment area? In other words, what is a finance major, who is interested in investment, most likely going to do as their future job? Secondly, I will explain what the stock and stock market is. Also, I will introduce a typical career, stock analyst, and which place a stock analyst usually work in, how stock analysts work in the stock investment area, and what their basic jobs are. Thirdly, I will explain what the bond and bond market is. Also, I will introduce the typical career, a bond analyst, for investment of finance major options to you through which career field they can work for, how bond analysts work in the bond investment area, and what basic jobs they do. Fourthly, what kinds of technology used in the finance area can help finance analysts to process their work more efficient. Fifthly I will give an explanation about the skills that a successful stock or bond analyst need. Aside from basic technology skills, they also need good communication skills and good learning attitudes. Hopeful you can get some useful information after reading my essay.</p>
<p>What is a finance major, who is interested in investment, most likely going to do as their future job? The things students are most concerned about are their future careers. We are going to talk about finance majors' future career positions for those who are interested in investment areas. Generally, most students who are interested in the financial investment field will become financial advisors in the future. Their job is to focus on helping individuals, firms, business organizations, and some government departments collect and evaluate business data and information, then advise them to make some business investments. The typical careers of finance majors, who are considering work in the stock and bond investment area in their future career, are stock analysts and bond analysts. There is a key point here that you should pay more attention to. If you consider working for personal investments, which means helping individuals do business investment in your future career time, you will become a stock analyst and bond analyst at the same time. That means when your clients want to do some investment in business, you should advise them and give them help in both the stock and bond area. On the other hand, if your future goal is to work for some large organizations to help them plan or do business investments, you will consider targeting a specific area in the stock investment field or bond investment field. In this case, you will only need to become a stock analyst or bond analyst in your future career. </p>
	<p>In the second section, I am going to talk about what the stock and stock market is. Also, I will introduce the typical career (stock analyst) that an investment of finance major chooses, and how stock analysts work in stock investment areas and what their basic jobs are. In order to help people understand the stock investment and stock analyst's job, first, let me explain the stock and stock market. Firstly, stock is equity investments that represent part ownership in a corporation you have, and you can receive earnings and assets from that firm. The risk is if the firm performs badly in the business area, you will lose your capital, and cannot earn a profit. There are two main types of stock: common stock and preferred stock. Common stock holders have the right to vote on major company decisions, such as whether or not to merge with another corporation, and receive dividends determined by management. Preferred stock holders can only receive earnings and assets by the firm's stock which they buy (The Free Dictionary. 2012). That means you can buy stock is one way to invest in the firms which you want, and there are two different types of stocks in the market you can choose: common stock and preferred stock.  After you buy the firm's stock, you will have the right to share the earnings and profits from that firm. That means if the company does well, the price of the stock will go up, then stockholders make a return on their investment. On the other hand, if the company does poorly, then the stock decreases in value and the stockholders lose their investment. This is the typical risk for stock. In addition, if you are a common stock holder, you can not only get dividends from the firm, but also you can join in this firm's business operations and make financial decisions together with this firm's managers. If you are a preferred stock holder, you cannot make decisions to affect the firm,s operation, but you still have the right to share the profits which were earned by that firm. Secondly, the stock market means the specific business organization does stock transactions through exchanges and over-the-counter. Corporations, organizations, and individuals can sell and buy stocks on the stock market.</p>
<p>After I introduced what is stock and stock market, now, I will explain how stock analysts work in stock investment area, and the primary jobs stock analysts do in the stock investment field. The majority of stock analysts work in banks, stock brokerages, insurance companies, government agencies and in large corporations. (This includes both individual stock analysts and stock analysts who work for large business organizations and government departments.) The most important job for stock analysts is collecting effective business information and evaluating business data in the financial market. "Stock analysts are often characterized as sophisticated information intermediaries, gathering and processing economy- and company-specific information to forecast future earnings and cash flows."(Sidhu, B., & Hwee Cheng, T. 2011) Stock analysts spend much time researching and examining financial data on stocks and companies, through spreadsheets and other forms of software. They look at the company's financial transaction results, market prices, and industry factors that might affect the price of the company's stock. Then they use this data and personal experiences to try to predict the future business trend of those companies, and give advice to their clients to determine when the proper time to buy or sell is (eHow.com 2012). In other words, stock analysts must have a strong strategy to collect and evaluate business information. Their primary jobs are through examining and evaluating firms' and corporations' business transactions to predict those firms' and corporations' future financial trend. Then, the stock analyst will give business suggestions to their clients, the business organizations and government departments which they work for, and individual investors. For example, these suggestions include which firm's stock should they buy, when should they buy, and when should they sell out to earn the maximum profits. Those are major jobs which stock analysts do in the financial investment area.</p>
	<p>Now, we shift to the third section what means bond and bond market, and introduce the typical career (bond analyst) that finance majors choose. Ellison and Jolly in their article "Pension Trustees Investment Guide", write "When you buy a bond, you are lending money to a government or a corporation. In return, you will be paid a fixed rate of interest, acoupon, at regular intervals before your original investment, the principal, is redeemed on a set date. As a trustee, bonds offer you a predictable stream of funding, which can be structured to give a close cash flow match for future liabilities. In particular, it gives you the opportunity to construct a safe harbor as a low-risk core to your holdings. But, over time, expectations change. When bonds are issued, the coupon is set at a rate high enough above the prevailing interest on bank deposits to attract you as an investor. This margin can be easily eroded by moves in interest rates or inflation. So, in managing a portfolio, you will want to think about buying and selling bonds, as a way of making sure that you continue to gain the best rates of return." (Ellison, Robin. Jolly, Adam. 2008)"In other words, local governments, U.S. government, and companies can issue bonds, and all bonds need a specific period of time to become mature. During this period, the bonds' holders can gain interest. (In most cases, bonds' holders will receive interest twice a year.) If the issuers want buy their bonds back, they have the right to do this, but they need to pay the price for their bonds' holders which they set up before they issue those bonds. In addition, the bonds have lower risk than stocks because the sum is just unpaid, and the interest rate will not change after you buy the bonds for a long time. But over a long period of time, if the rate of the bond remains very high, then more and more people will try to hold this bond. In this case, the phenomenon of inflation will appear, and bond holders' benefits will be eroded. At this point, bond holders need to think whether to still hold this bond or sell it. Secondly, just as the name implies the bond market is financial market where participants can issue new debt or buy and sell debt securities. The primary goal of the bond market is to provide a mechanism for long term funding for public or private expenditures.</p>
	<p>After discussing bond and bond market, now, I am going to talk about bond analyst. In the academic journal "The Informational Role of Bond Analyst" De Franco tells us, "Bond analysts identify whether firms' credit fundamentals are improving or weakening, and forecast whether firms' bond securities are likely to outperform (or underperform) relative to bonds of comparable risk with similar contractual features. This analysis is reflected in an investment recommendation (i.e., buy, hold, or sell) issued to bond investors. In addition, bond analysts, reports provide an extensive review of firms' financial performance, including detailed examinations of EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), free cash flow, capital expenditures, and liquidity and leverage ratios. The implications of firms' growth potential on these measures are often discussed" (De Franco, Gus. 2009). In other words the bond analyst's job is also collecting and evaluating business information, such as which bond has a lower investment risk, what their performances in the business area are, and whether this organization is profitable. Then, determine which bond they should advise their client to buy or which bond they should suggest the corporation to invest. In order to determine which bond has lower risk, the analyst generally considers those factors, such as firms' financial performance, free cash flow, capital expenditures, liquidity and leverage ratios, future growth potential, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and so on. That means collecting and evaluating business information and data is as important for bond analysts as for stock analysts. In addition, as stock analysts, bond analysts generally work in banks, insurance companies, some government departments, and large corporations.</p>
	<p>The new developed technology makes the financial process much easier and more efficient than before. MSU finance professor Huang says that the new statistic software can collects millions of data from large corporations, and estimate their future cash flow within few minutes. That helps the finance analysts (both stock and bond analysts) can save lots of time when make business decision, and decreased the chance making process errors. </p>   
<p>	Lastly, if you want to choose stock analyst or bond analyst to be your future career, only knowing the technical strategy on investment is not enough. You should learn how to control a good communication skill and keep studying new things in your life. Professors Huang says that business data may different in every second. She also says, if students want to performance well in finance area, they must have excellent communication skills. That means good communication skill is a really important social skill for stock analysts and bond analysts, and keep learning attitude is a really important personal characteristic for both stock analysts and bond analysts. Financial analysts must be lifelong learners since they must continually keep up-to-date with new markets, regulations and laws that affect the economy. Also, financial analysts must have good communication skills to communicate difficult and technical financial information to the general public. They must explain the business situation and give suggestion to their clients very clearly. They must have highly analytical minds that are geared towards problem solving. In other words, stock analysts and bond analysts are part of financial analyst. So if you want to be a successful stock analyst or bond analyst, only have technical skills to know how to do business investments is not enough. You must keep learning new events, new business laws, and all new things happened in business world throughout your whole life. Because things in the business area are changing in every second as Huang said, you should keep learning and improving yourself stay caught up. On the other hand, stock analyst and bond analyst must know how to communicate with other people in an effective way. Because, for both stock analysts and bond analysts, they will spend much time on their career to communicate with business organizations' managers in order to get advanced business data and information, and give suggestions to their clients to do financial investment. That means without good learning attitude and proper communication skill, people cannot become a successful finance analyst. </p> 
<p>In conclusion, financial investment is emphasis on stock investment and bond investment. That means both stock investment and bond investment are business methods that can help investors gain benefits, but both of them may have invested risks. Basically, the stock investments have higher risk than bond investments. The majority of finance majors who are interested in financial investment field will choose stock analyst or bond analyst to be their future career. (But if you want to be a personal investment advisor, then you will be stock analyst and bond analyst at the same time, as I said before.) Through collecting and evaluating business data and information, we can predict the specific stock or bond's future financial trend, and help individuals or corporations gain maximum investment profits is the primary job for both stock analyst and bond analyst. The highly improved technology can make finance process and finance analysts' job easier and more efficient than before. Also, if you want to be a successful finance analyst, you should be a life-long learner and keep the most advanced business information, and you should control good communication skills to communicate with your client or corporation managers effectively.</p>
